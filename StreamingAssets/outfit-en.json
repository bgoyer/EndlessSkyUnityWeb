Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first. (As a safety measure, all ships are able to harvest tiny amounts of fuel by flying close to a star, but this outfit allows you to accumulate fuel much more quickly. The closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate.)"
